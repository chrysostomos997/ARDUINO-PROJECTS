# Arduino-Rfid smart access with LCD


This project demonstrates the power of using Arduino and RFID technology to create an efficient and secure access control system.

The system works by using an RFID reader to detect the unique ID of an RFID tag, which is then matched against a database of authorized users.
If the ID is found in the database, the system grants access and displays a welcome message on the LCD display. 
If the ID is not found, access is denied, and a message indicating the same is displayed on the LCD.

The LCD display provides real-time feedback to the user, making it easy to understand the status of their access request. 
It adds an extra layer of security to the system, as it allows the user to confirm whether their access request has been granted or not.

One of the great advantages of using an Arduino-based system for this project is the flexibility and customizability it offers.
With the use of various sensors and modules, the system can be easily expanded to include features such as real-time monitoring, automatic alerts, and user logins.
