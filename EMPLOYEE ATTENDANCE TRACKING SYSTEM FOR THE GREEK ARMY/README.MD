# EMPLOYEE ATTENDACE TRACKING SYSTEM FOR THE GREEK ARMY 

This project was made during my mandatory 12 month service in Greek army.

This project aims to develop an efficient employee attendance tracking system for the Greek Army, utilizing Arduino Uno, RFID reader, RTC module, and SD card module. The system is designed to accurately monitor and record the arrival times of 70 officers equipped with RFID cards. By leveraging these hardware components, the project enables seamless data collection, storage, and analysis, promoting effective workforce management within the Greek Army.

The Arduino Uno serves as the central controller, facilitating communication between the RFID reader and the RTC module. The RFID reader scans the unique identifiers embedded in the RFID cards, identifying each officer as they enter the premises. The RTC module ensures precise timekeeping, synchronizing with the system's internal clock to maintain accurate timestamp records.

To ensure secure data storage, the SD card module is integrated into the system. Employee arrival times are logged and saved on the SD card, providing a reliable method of data storage. The system also incorporates error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and prevent information loss.

The proposed attendance tracking system offers numerous benefits, including improved accuracy, efficiency, and accountability. With real-time monitoring and reliable data logging, the Greek Army can enhance their attendance tracking processes, facilitate fair compensation, and promote a culture of punctuality and accountability among officers. This system contributes to overall operational effectiveness and fosters a positive work environment within the Greek Army.

In conclusion, this project presents an effective solution for monitoring and recording officer arrival times within the Greek Army, utilizing Arduino Uno, RFID reader, RTC module, and SD card module. By leveraging these technologies, the Greek Army can streamline their attendance tracking processes, foster punctuality among officers, and optimize workforce management strategies to ensure operational excellence.
